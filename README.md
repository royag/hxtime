UTC-time and TimeZone library for Haxe

UTC: Crossplatform routines for converting between Dates and Unix-timestamp, that support dates before 1970 and 64-bit timestamps (Int64). These are modified algorithms ported from Minix, which is available under BSD-license.

TZInfo: TimeZone routines for parsing unix tz-files, and for converting dates from local timezones to UTC/GMT. I don't remember from where these were ported, that's why it's stated "Other Open Source".

Look at the test-code for examples of use.

Reports of bugs is very much appreciated.
